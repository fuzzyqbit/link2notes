## Project

**Link To Notes**

A tool that turns a YouTube link (or any audio file) into beginner-friendly sheet music for a single-line wind instrument — flute, clarinet, bass clarinet, alto sax, tenor sax, or baritone sax. Currently ships as a Python desktop app (pywebview shell around `converter.py`) and a static web app under `web/` deployed to GitHub Pages. This milestone shifts the primary product to the web app so anyone can "search it up and run it" with zero install.

**Core Value:** A learner gets a readable, playable score for their chosen wind instrument from a song link or audio file, with no install and no account.

### Constraints

- **Tech stack (web)**: Static ES modules, CDN-loaded deps (esm.sh + jsdelivr). No build step. Anything requiring a bundler is out unless we accept adding tooling.
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages — static files only, no server, no env secrets.
- **Browser compatibility**: Modern evergreen browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge). iOS Safari matters because users will try on phones.
- **YouTube**: Cannot fetch YouTube media client-side. All YouTube flows route through external user-driven downloaders.
- **ML model**: `@spotify/basic-pitch` model loads from CDN; cold load is multi-MB. First-use latency is a real UX constraint.

## Project Skills

| Skill | Description | Path |
|-------|-------------|------|
| cavecrew | > Decision guide for delegating to caveman-style subagents. Tells the main thread WHEN to spawn `cavecrew-investigator` (locate code), `cavecrew-builder` (1-2 file edit), or `cavecrew-reviewer` (diff review) instead of doing the work inline or using vanilla `Explore`. Subagent output is caveman-compressed so the tool-result injected back into main context is ~60% smaller — main context lasts longer across long sessions. Trigger: "delegate to subagent", "use cavecrew", "spawn investigator/builder/reviewer", "save context", "compressed agent output". | `.agents/skills/cavecrew/SKILL.md` |
| caveman | > Ultra-compressed communication mode. Cuts token usage ~75% by speaking like caveman while keeping full technical accuracy. Supports intensity levels: lite, full (default), ultra, wenyan-lite, wenyan-full, wenyan-ultra. Use when user says "caveman mode", "talk like caveman", "use caveman", "less tokens", "be brief", or invokes /caveman. Also auto-triggers when token efficiency is requested. | `.agents/skills/caveman/SKILL.md` |
| caveman-commit | > Ultra-compressed commit message generator. Cuts noise from commit messages while preserving intent and reasoning. Conventional Commits format. Subject ≤50 chars, body only when "why" isn't obvious. Use when user says "write a commit", "commit message", "generate commit", "/commit", or invokes /caveman-commit. Auto-triggers when staging changes. | `.agents/skills/caveman-commit/SKILL.md` |
| caveman-compress | > Compress natural language memory files (CLAUDE.md, todos, preferences) into caveman format to save input tokens. Preserves all technical substance, code, URLs, and structure. Compressed version overwrites the original file. Human-readable backup saved as FILE.original.md. Trigger: /caveman-compress FILEPATH or "compress memory file" | `.agents/skills/caveman-compress/SKILL.md` |
| caveman-help | > Quick-reference card for all caveman modes, skills, and commands. One-shot display, not a persistent mode. Trigger: /caveman-help, "caveman help", "what caveman commands", "how do I use caveman". | `.agents/skills/caveman-help/SKILL.md` |
| caveman-review | > Ultra-compressed code review comments. Cuts noise from PR feedback while preserving the actionable signal. Each comment is one line: location, problem, fix. Use when user says "review this PR", "code review", "review the diff", "/review", or invokes /caveman-review. Auto-triggers when reviewing pull requests. | `.agents/skills/caveman-review/SKILL.md` |
| caveman-stats | > Show real token usage and estimated savings for the current session. Reads directly from the Claude Code session log — no AI estimation. Triggers on /caveman-stats. Output is injected by the mode-tracker hook; the model itself does not compute the numbers. | `.agents/skills/caveman-stats/SKILL.md` |

## GSD Workflow Enforcement

Before using Edit, Write, or other file-changing tools, start work through a GSD command so planning artifacts and execution context stay in sync.

Use these entry points:
- `/gsd-quick` for small fixes, doc updates, and ad-hoc tasks
- `/gsd-debug` for investigation and bug fixing
- `/gsd-execute-phase` for planned phase work

Do not make direct repo edits outside a GSD workflow unless the user explicitly asks to bypass it.
